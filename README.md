# Myna Ruby/EventMachine Client

This is a Ruby client for the v1 Myna API, using EventMachine for asychronous goodness.


## Development Notes

The easiest way to install the dependencies is to install [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) and then run `bundle install`

Run `rake test` to run the tests. It helps to have Myna running locally for this :)
